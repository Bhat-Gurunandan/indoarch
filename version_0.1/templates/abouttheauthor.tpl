    Like Hieun Tsang during the Golden Age of the Guptas, Takeo Kamiya
    travelled through India and wrote about his discoveries. The first
    time he came to India, was by bus on the Asia highway from London to
    Kathmandu. He remembers it was a comparatively peaceful time with the
    Vietnam War just ending, and the strife in Afghanistan and the Iranian
    revolution, just beginning.  Looking at the Herculean effort it must
    have taken for one man to put together such a book; one can only
    imagine the kind of motivation and consistency it took. The exchange
    rate at that time was 35 yen to the rupee and it was very hard on the
    young Kamiya who was poor.

    The initial three-month tour was not a pleasant one and sufficient
    information was difficult to come by.  Yet Kamiya says, when he
    finally reached the monument he was looking for, it was an intense
    emotional experience for him. He decided to write a book about this
    form of architecture that was completely alien to him.  He divided
    India into small areas and spent six weeks exploring each small area,
    seeking out all the architectural structures it held. It took him 30
    years to cover the subcontinent. His book The Guide to the
    Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent was published in Japan on 20
    September 1996. It went into a first reprint on 28 March 1997, just
    six months later.

    Takeo Kamiya was born in Tokyo in 1946. He graduated from Tokyo
    Geijutsu Daigaku (Fine Arts faculty, in Architecture.  In 1971 he
    worked as Design in-charge in Kazumasa Yamashita Building Research
    Institute.  He established the Takeo Kamiya design office in 1980 and
    was a member of Japan Architects Association. He was also a member of
    Japan Architects Academy.  Among his works is the town house in
    Yokohama, where he won the highest award in the Kanagawa construction
    contest in 1983. This was the first of many other prizes and awards
    like the SD review contest for his cloister; the GID competition prize
    of 1991 for his Paradise Garden and many more.  He turned his hand to
    writing and wrote Architectural Culture of Islam in 1978, Architecture
    of Hinduism 1993 and The Guide to the Architecture of the Indian
    Subcontinent in 1996.
