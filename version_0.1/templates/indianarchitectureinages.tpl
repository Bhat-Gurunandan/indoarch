<b>Classification of Indian Architecture through the Ages</b>

<p>
    Before we introduce Indian architecture, let us take a look at the
    history of India. Although, in this book, Indian history has been
    broadly classified into Ancient Times, Middle Ages and Modern Age, it
    is not defined as clearly as is European history. With European
    architecture, historical terminology has been used, making it easier
    to conjure a mental image.  The objective of this book is not to
    classify Indian history, but to view it from different methods of
    construction used over the ages.

<em>Ancient Times</em>

<p>
    Indian civilization begins with the Indus civilization that dates back
    about 4000 years. The famous cities of Harappa and Mohenjadaro are now
    in Pakistan, while the ruins of Lothal are in India. Aryans from the
    west settled in India and developed "Vedic" literature as part of the
    Brahman religion. These became the Holy Books of the religion, which
    later came to be known as Hinduism.  During the 5th-6th centuries BC,
    Gautama Siddharta became Buddha and started Buddhism and Vardhamana
    became Mahavira and started Jainism. Buddhism had the support of the
    royal class and was adopted by the masses. As Buddhism spread across
    the country, so did its monasteries and temples. As Hinduism
    re-established itself strongly, the Buddhist presence disappeared from
    India in the 13th century.  Cave temples typically represent the
    architecture of Ancient Times. Naturally there must have been castles,
    palaces and houses during that time, but none of those remain, because
    buildings constructed of wood, rotted or burned easily. Temples were
    built of bricks, but when Buddhism died out, these were destroyed or
    pulled down due to a lack of protectors. However, cave temples and
    monasteries still exist today because they were carved out of rock - a
    much stronger material. There are around 1,200 such cave temples and
    monasteries left and 75 per cent of them belong to Buddhism.

<em>Middle Ages</em>

<p>
    As they were not satisfied with cave temples, entire sculpted
    rock temples were built during the Middle Ages. A few still exist unto
    the present day. In contrast to the rock temples that imitated wooden
    temples of ancient times, the stone temples, built by laying cut
    stones one on top of another, came to be the model of sculpted stone
    construction.  But since these developed together, there is no line
    dividing the ages in terms of centuries.  Construction of stone
    temples commenced in the 5th century, during the Gupta dynasty, but
    was standardized only during the 8th century. Many stone temples were
    built between the 7th and 9th centuries, but the temples carved out of
    rocks were constructed up till the 12th century. Hence according to
    the history of architecture, the transition from ancient times to the
    Middle Ages took many centuries.  Buddhism took the lead in
    construction during ancient times and in contrast, Hinduism took the
    lead during the Middle Ages followed by Jainism. The method of stone
    construction improved by leaps and bounds in north and south
    India. The style caught on and very soon the whole of India was filled
    with stone structures.

    The Chandella dynasty in the north and the Chola dynasty in the south
    showed remarkable developments in architecture, by building
    magnificent temples, using stone.  Islam entered India during the 11th
    century and established power in Delhi during the 13th century. Till
    the 16th century, the Turkish and Afghan dynasties continued to rule
    Delhi during a period referred to as the "Delhi Sultanate".  Western
    styles of architecture, including techniques like domes were brought
    to India during this age and had a strong influence on building
    styles. This period called the Middle Ages, and the advent of the
    Mughals who conquered most of India, signalled the beginning of the
    Modern Age.

<em>Modern Age</em>

<p>
    Mughal rule spread into more than half the sub-continent and the
    splendid Mughal style, which is a mix of the Indo-Islamic construction
    style, also blossomed. At that time, the Vijayanagara kingdom, which
    is predominantly Hindu, flourished in south India. At the same time,
    the Nayaks who were also Hindus ruled over some areas in the
    south. Both these dynasties appreciated technical developments with
    the main themes being large-scale construction, complex expressions
    and elaborate decorations. This phase is called the Modern
    Age. Emperor Akbar's Hindu-Islamic fusion in north India and the
    lavish Dravidian style of construction in the south are remarkable
    styles of this age.  Modern Age Indian architecture also includes the
    British era in India, until its Independence in 1947. British rule
    coincided with the decline of the Mughal era and the revival of
    Hinduism. The construction during this time was an adaptation of the
    Indian style in the colonial style brought from Europe.  The direct
    impact of British architecture was seen from the second half of the
    19th century, when research on Indian architectural history advanced
    and the Mughal style influenced colonial constructions. It is referred
    to as the Indo-Saracenic style.  The Present As we plunge into the age
    of Modernism (post-Indian Independence), we have to say that
    architectural styles differed largely until then. A major influence on
    Indian architecture, post-Independence, was that of French architect,
    Le Corbusier, who designed Chandigarh and various buildings in
    Ahmedabad. Indian architects, educated in Europe and America also made
    a mark, but trying to transplant the architecture of Europe and
    America that was very different in history and style had its own
    problems. It is only right to call modern architecture "Cosmopolitan
    architecture".

    The 600-odd buildings in the book, are grouped together according to
    their similarities. To enable the traveller to decide which place to
    visit, the buildings are given a star rating, from 0 to 3. The rating
    is based on the fascinating quality of the building. If a building has
    archaeological importance, but is in ruins, then it is given a low
    rating. Ratings are also given from 1 to 3, with regards to the
    region, the importance or number of buildings, natural scenery,
    etc. This is done as a subjective measure to help the traveller use
    this as a yardstick while planning his journey.
