
<p> As a student of architecture in the 70's, I had a dream of doing
documentation on the lines of this book. The thought of travelling
around each and every part of India seemed so challenging and
romantic, and the task so worthy.  I would astonish the world with the
amazing diversity of the architecture of my country. On beginning an
architectural practice, this dream did not seem at all feasible but on
each personal discovery of an architectural marvel, I invariably felt
a sense of guilt.
</p>

<p> Then in 2000 on a visit to Tokyo for the East Wind Conference, I
was gifted the Japanese version of this marvellous book. The English
version did not exist and shockingly there were no plans to bring one
out. I begged, cajoled and finally succeeded through a letter campaign
where K.T. Ravindran, P. R. Mehta and Amita Baig wrote to TOTO (the
Japanese publishers) on the importance of bringing out the book in
India.
</p>

<p> This book deals with the monuments of the subcontinent, but the
discussion must begin at a lower plane. Vernacular Architecture is our
starting point and is similar to the flora and fauna of a region. It
springs from the ground like the wild flowers, perfect in its use of
material, siting and taming of the weather. It also embodies the local
lifestyle and its process of evolution is completely unconscious.
</p>

<p> However, when it came to building the monuments of a place - the
religious buildings, palaces, tombs and civil structures, the Master
Builder stepped in. These buildings were large and meant to impress,
often symbolizing a particular faith or way of life. Unlike Vernacular
Architecture, materials and craftsmen could be brought from a distance
and of course ideas could come from as far as man had travelled. But
often enough the inspiration was local and from the vernacular.  For
example, the shape of a haystack could inspire the crest of a temple.
</p>

<p> Leaf through the book and marvel at the variety on display. It
does not appear to come from a single country or lineage, but it can
be argued that India is a vast country with a startlingly diverse
geography, consisting of the Himalayas, high altitude deserts, rain
forests and other more common features (only by Indian standards). But
this only partly explains the variety.
</p>

<p> India (unlike China) has rarely been a centrally ruled
country. Moreover she has many religions and cultures co-existing and
competing. It is this plurality, which greatly contributes to the
excellence and variety on display. But there is also the genius of the
Indian Master Builder whose approach to design was different. Unlike
the Western architect who approached the subject from a total
conception and moved down to the details, the Indian temple designer
moved from both ends, simultaneously. The details playing a major
role, affected the final outcome in a most startling way, creating
monuments of great beauty and uniqueness. One impetus must have been
the greatest tradition of Rock Cut Architecture on this earth, which
trained his mind to think in a completely different dimension.
</p>

<p> Strangely enough the greatest flowering of Islamic Architecture is
in India. Though their main thrust was Islamic, they evolved in a
completely different way from their place of origin, as they were
interwoven with local Hindu traditions of the time.  I believe it is
these qualities which lured Takeo Kamiya to return each year over a
20-year period to complete this great documentation. Motivation and
consistency of this quality is rare and it pleases me immensely that
the Indian Institute of Architects has decided to honour him.  This
book means a lot to me. To begin with it is a clarion call for all of
us who have a stake in the preservation of our Architectural
Heritage. These monuments are under great threat from the forces of
"development" and commercialization and a complete absence of
sensitivity. It is our duty to put into place sensible management
plans for all these monuments.
</p>

<p> Unfortunately, the forces of globalization have reduced
architecture to a universal product. One cannot tell anymore where one
is, by the buildings we see around us and there is sameness, which is
creeping in. The variety in this book should be an inspiration for us
architects to create more sympathetic and distinctive architecture. It
would be a Modern Architecture no doubt; but one which reflects the
spirit, climate and resources of a place.
</p>

<p> I have a request to make to all the users of this book. It has
been 26 years since the research of this book began and obviously
aspects of the infrastructure of a place have changed. I'd really be
grateful for feedback on this, so that the next edition can be
corrected.
</p>

<p>This English Edition would not have been possible without my
collaborator and patroness of the Arts, Sangita Jindal. I must also
thank Shri Jagmohan, Honourable Minister of Tourism and Culture and
Ms. Rathi Vinay Jha and Mr. Amitabh Kant of the Ministry of Tourism. A
special thanks to our amazing editor Annabel Lopez, who fortunately
for me has supported all my quixotic projects.
