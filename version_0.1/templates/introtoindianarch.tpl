India nurtured various cultures in ancient times. Along with
literature, fine art, music, dance and drama, architecture too, in all
its grandeur, rose to great heights.  It is not easy to explain Indian
architecture; it is entirely different from that of Europe.
</p>
<p>
James Fergusson, the architectural historian, analysed Indian
architecture for the first time in his book, History of Indian and
Eastern Architecture. Fergusson recognized two types of architecture:
Architecture of Intellect, with the Parthenon in Greece as its ideal,
and Architecture of Emotions, with the Halebid Temple in India as the
best of this form.  He added that forms of architecture in the world
lie between these two extremes. If there is something which could be
referred to as 'complete architecture' it should exist somewhere in
between these two monuments.
</p>
<p>
The Hoysaleshwara Temple at Halebid, dates back to the Hoysala dynasty
that ruled over south India in the 12th century. This spectacular
temple, built over a large area, is filled with sculptures both on the
exterior and the interior. Fergusson says that this is a structure
which appeals more to Man's senses than to his reasoning power. Most
Hindu temples in India are filled with sculptures. The temples at
Khajuraho and Konark also have images of men and women in various
sexual poses. If this type of architecture represents the "doctrine of
pleasure" then the Cistercian monasteries in Europe must represent the
"doctrine of abstinence". When one compares the Cistercian monasteries
that banned sculptures and murals as a hindrance to their meditation,
then these Hindu temples seem to be the diametric opposite.

<p>
Islamic architecture plays a major role in India's architectural
history. Idol worship is prohibited in Islam and there are absolutely
no statues or murals inside mosques. The structure is a symmetrical,
geometric shape and the space inside is bright, in contrast to Hindu
temples.

Geographically, India is a large country with different climactic
conditions from the north to the south; hence the style of the
buildings across the country was also different. Moreover, ancient
India did not ever have centralized rule. The Mauryas in the 3rd
century BC and the Mughals between the 16th and 17th centuries reigned
over most of India. These were the only times when most of the country
came under central rule. Otherwise, different kings ruled over
different parts of the country, until colonization, and all of them
have contributed to the development of different cultures.
</p>
<p>
European architectural history is clearly defined according to the
ages, into Roman, Greek, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo and
modern, but Indian architecture cannot be compartmentalized in this
way. This is because India is a complex nation geographically and
historically, with a diverse architectural heritage.
</p>
<p>
Yet architecture in one region in India is not entirely different from
the other. The Indian sub-continent is bounded by the sea on the south
and the Himalayas and China in the north, and therefore has had little
contact with the outside world. If one has to analyze it, unity in
diversity is the key to Indian culture. Diverse geography, rulers,
religions and eras, together created a fascinating architectural
mosaic.

What strikes one when travelling in a taxi, is that the driver does
not use a road map. Asking for the way in towns and villages, with
people offering directions and advice, is how the trip
continues. Instead of starting on a trip equipped with a detailed map,
accumulating the whole in parts, is the Indian way. This is perhaps
the basis for the construction method of vernacular architecture in
the villages and even in the cities of India. While it would be wrong
to say that Indian architecture is "lacking in totality", it would be
more accurate to point out that Indian architecture is "rich in
detail".
