<b>Airways</b>

<p>
Since India is a big country, one will need to fly to save
time. Previously, there was only the state owned Indian Airlines, but
in recent years, there are many private airlines that have aircraft
flying to smaller towns. Here I should caution that the flight to the
Himalayas and Ladakh often gets cancelled due to bad weather. It is
better to reserve in advance on a well-established airline.

<b>Railways</b>

<p>
This is the oldest mode of transportation in India, and since there
are not many electric trains, it will mean travelling in steam trains
that have not changed in 50 years. Nevertheless, India has one of the
most distinguished railroad systems in the world and the width of the
rails is classified into broad gauge, narrow gauge and metre
gauge. The express trains become sleepers at night, from 9 p m to 7 a
m. If you do not have a sleeper reservation, you may not be able to
board the train at night.  The big terminals have counters exclusively
for foreign tourists and they sell national and regional train
timetables in English.

<b>Buses</b>

<p>
There are many buses to a single destination and they are convenient
since they are capable of taking small sharp turns. However, the seats
are narrow, which results in quickly tiring the traveller.  Try to get
a seat in the front section of the bus. The good thing is, especially
in south India, if you can enjoy the natural scenery, even a long
journey is not boring. It is advisable to confirm the time and your
seat reservation at the bus stand on the previous day. For your
information, a long-distance bus does an average of only 30 km per
hour.

<b>Taxis</b>

<p>
Long distance taxi charges should be bargained and resolved every
time. It is sound policy to contact a number of drivers and speak to
them about the tour itinerary. There are times when you decide on the
charge according to your tour itinerary and there are times when you
pay by the kilometre. The rent-a-car system is not very popular in
India.

<b>Rickshaws</b>

<p>
In the bigger cities one can travel around in taxis, but in small
towns, it is easier to get around in a rickshaw.  There are three
types of rickshaws. The most primitive is the hand-pulled rickshaw,
which can be seen only in Calcutta. Then there are cycle rickshaws
that travel slowly and are appropriate if one wants to enjoy the
hustle and bustle of the place.  The rates are cheap and you can
bargain before getting in. However, these rickshaws are getting fewer
by the year and motor powered rickshaws, called autos, are becoming
more popular.  They are fast, make a lot of noise and are also the
cause of considerable air pollution.
