Besides high- budget hotels, low-budget ones like Hotel Central Point, are also available. Reservations for these may not be made   outside India, but the information counter at Delhi airport helps with hotels for various budgets and also with  reservations. Visitors are advised to be cautious and deal only with authorised agents. \r\n<p>\r\nConnaught Place, the core business district,  is convenient for shopping; also many        airlines have their offices located here. There is a reservation counter inside Jeevan Bharati. One can make reservations for    travel within the country at the Indian Airlines office, nearby. Galgotia Bookshop and the New Book Depot, stock books on           architecture. Archaeological Survey of India’s publications are on sale at the    counter inside the National Museum. The bookshop will freight the books you buy, to your address back home,  for a fee. Janpath Street has the offices of the Survey of India that sells maps of the region.\r\n<p>\r\nDelhi is historically, a very important city. One can sight-see in a taxi or by auto      rickshaw. It is sometimes difficult however,  to get transport to Delhi or New Delhi station to catch the night train. If you do get a taxi, be prepared to pay an exorbitant rate.\r\n</P>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Punjab</b><br />\r\n\r\nChandigarh and Amritsar are two cities      which are accessible by air and rail. Chandigarh is 3 hours from Delhi by the Shatabdi Express while Amritsar is five-and-a-half hours away. Express buses ply between the two cities. \r\nAmritsar International is a good hotel, while in Chandigarh, hotels near Piccadilly are     recommended. Foreigners are not allowed entry into Le Corbusier\\\'s Capitol complex.\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<b>Himachal Pradesh</b><br />\r\n\r\nBroad gauge trains ply from Kalka. They are metre-gauge from Kalka  to Shimla. One can also fly to Shimla which is  five hours by road from Chandigarh and seven hours from Rampur. A taxi from Rampur to Sarahan takes one-and-a-half hours. It is advisable to stay at Hotel Shrikhand, near Bhima Kali Temple. One can hire a van to visit Kamru, Hatkoti and south Sarahan. Manali, is ten and a half hours by road from Shimla. Reservations for the Castle Hotel at Nagar, can be made at the tourist office in Kullu. Chamba in the west, is five hours from Pathankot, while Pathankot to Amritsar is a three-hour trip. Bharmaur is accessible by bus from Chamba, but a taxi is safer and a one-way ride takes three-and-a-half hours. While in Chamba, Hotel Irawati is a good place to stay at.  A convenient midway halt for the above destinations is Mandi or Kullu. Take a bus or a taxi to the temples.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Kashmir</b><br />\r\n\r\nWhen Kashmir became a disputed territory in the 1980s, entry for foreigners into the area has been periodically banned. Visit Kashmir at any time of the year, except     winters. Kashmir\\\'s  climate is cooler than that of the rest of India and therefore the hot Indian summers (April-May) is peak season here.  Kashmir has had negligible tourist   traffic due to the turmoil. The army has taken up most of the hotels, but tourists can stay in the houseboats on Dal Lake. Staying in one of the  deluxe houseboats is a rare and remarkable experience. \r\n<p>\r\nAfter negotiating the price at  the taxi-stand,  you can arrange for a daily taxi pick-up and visit the gardens and ruins of Kashmir. It is pleasant to have lunch surrounded by all the greenery with the sound of running water, so a packed lunch would be a good idea.\r\n</P>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Ladakh</b><br />\r\n\r\nThe bus journey from Srinagar to Ladakh takes two days. The mountain passes are sealed off in winter so buses ply only between June and October. Ladakh can also be accessed by air, but be careful about altitude sickness, when flying in. \r\n<p> \r\nWhen in Ladakh, stay in Leh and perhaps one night in Kargil. Ga-Ldan Continental, in Leh is a good, simple hotel. The gompas (monasteries) can be visited every day by hiring a taxi from the taxi stand, for an agreed upon price. The rates are higher than in the plains as one has no bargaining power here. You are allowed inside the gompas  for a fee but there is no charge for photography. \r\nAll the monasteries can be seen in a day\\\'s trip, except for Lamayaru, for which a halt at Alchi, is essential. The only accommodation here is one of two inns standing adjacent to each other. It is better to stock up on food and water in Leh. If travelling by taxi from Srinagar, one can stop en route at Murbek. It is then possible to visit Lamayaru and stay overnight at Alchi; an expensive option, as it takes three nights to reach Leh. Drivers can also be hired in Kargil, but they will need the required travel permit. \r\n</P>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>AGRA</b><br />\r\n\r\nThe Shatabdi Express runs from Delhi to Agra and back, on a day’s trip. If on an    architectural tour, stay in Agra or Sikandra for two days, then take in Fatehpur Sikri on the  third day. \r\n<p>\r\nAgra has a number of starred hotels. Grand Hotel, which is medium budget, is fairly good. Autos provide for comfortable        transportation so it is better to engage one for the entire day. Visit Fatehpur Sikri by taxi,    but if one wishes to merely go there and back,  take a bus. Meals in Fatehpur Sikri are available near Buland Gate.  The Delhi-Agra-Jaipur triangle is connected by rail and  bus routes.  For Brindavan, take the bus to Mathura, (1 hour 30 minutes) and then return in a taxi, after visiting the museum.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Varanasi</b><br />\r\n\r\nIf you have a tight schedule, take the air-route, Delhi-Agra-Khajuraho-Varanasi. The Shatabdi Express from Delhi takes 6 hours, or one can fly to Lucknow and take the five hour bus/train journey to Allahabad. The Allahabad-Varanasi leg is 3 hours. Taking the overnight train from Lucknow saves time.

The Buddhist culture flourished during the 3rd century BC when Emperor Ashoka reigned over India and Kashmir came under his rule. Kashmir is dotted with Buddhist ruins that belong to this age, but most of them are foundations of structures and there is no way of knowing what the buildings looked like. \r\n<p>\r\nAlexander introduced the Hellenic culture, during the 4th century BC. Gandhara region now in north Pakistan has Buddhist sculptures where Hellenic influences can be seen.  Perhaps Hellenic culture also influenced the architecture of that time. Glimpses of it can be seen in temples built during the Hindu era, especially in the corridors surrounding the Hindu   temples of Buniyar and Martand. Stone structures developed during the Hindu age. The roofs during this era differed from the roofs in the plains. Since Kashmir gets a lot of rain and snow, the roofs slope in a steep incline that makes them look like spires. \r\n<p>\r\nIslam spread during the 14th century and a large number of mosques were built. They are atypical in that they were built of wood with a spire covering them, instead of a dome. Wooden mosques are not seen anywhere else in India, except in Kashmir and Kerala. This is  because Muslims adopted the           traditional architectural style used for Hindu temples even though they changed the construction material. Another characteristic feature of that era is the       gardens. Akbar conquered Kashmir in 1588 and   floating gardens and river palaces were built for him. Jehangir (1605-27)  captivated by Kashmir’s beauty planted Chenar trees and built pleasure gardens.\r\nTourist sights in Kashmir are concentrated in and around Srinagar as the rest of Kashmir is largely mountainous terrain. One can now fly into Srinagar from Delhi or Jammu, but in the past the journey had to be made by horse-cart from Rawalpindi and  could take an indefinite number of days. Chuta Ito wrote his impressions after reaching Kashmir. “Here I could get my first ever panoramic view of Kashmir. This is the first time I had ever seen such a vast landscape in its entirety. It looks like I have left this earth and entered Heaven.” Since the 90\\\'s, this paradise has been       witness to a great deal of turmoil due to insurgency and terrorism and the situation seems to be           deteriorating. As a result, the numbers of tourists in the area have dwindled. Travel to this region has become very difficult and dangerous, but on the other hand, there’s the definite benefit of enjoying the quiet       serenity of Kashmir with no tourists around.\r\n</p>',1,NULL,NULL),(10,'R=1+S=1+P=1+M=585','Srinagar on the edge of Dal Lake is Kashmir’s most important town. Greenery in summer,  snow in winter and the crystal clear lake are unforgettable sights. Some houseboats on Dal Lake are regular residences, while others are quaint hotels for tourists. Delicate arabesque patterns adorn the exteriors. The houseboats used as hotels, have a wide living-room, dining- room and three or four bedrooms with bath-rooms attached. Meals are usually prepared by a housekeeper. An early morning riser is refreshed by the gentle, cool breeze blowing over the water. The morning sunshine sparkling on the lake and the mountains, makes the   landscape look like an exquisite painting.\r\n<p>\r\nThere is a network of roads besides which, the Jhelum River is also used as a transportation network, with people moving around in tiny boats called shikaras. There were nine wooden bridges over the Jhelum River but some were destroyed during the years of strife. Even mosques and houses are made of wood.

Jami is a mosque for a larger gathering. It is also called Jum’a or Jumma, which means Friday mosque. Just as there is only one cathedral in each diocese in the Christian context, it was fundamental that there be only one Jami in each town. When the faithful collect for prayers and the capacity of the prayer hall is insufficient, believers overflow into the courtyard. There is no single space demarcated for prayers in a mosque.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Jami Masjid is the most magnificent and fascinating of all wooden mosques in Kashmir. Originally built of wood in 1385 by Sultan Sikander Butshikan, it was destroyed in a fire some time later. It was rebuilt and this time the exterior walls were made of brick. The present mosque was built in 1674 and belongs to the era when Aurangazeb was emperor.\r\n<p>\r\nTo the west of the courtyard, is an arched entrance called iwan, or liwan in Western India, built in the traditional style. This iwan faces Mecca and has a prayer room inside. However, it is not a Persian iwan but a cube with a pyramid roof. This style has been adopted from the Hindu temples in Kashmir.  The spire acts as a minaret calling the faithful to assemble for prayers. The other three iwans are just simple entrances allowing access into the courtyard.\r\n<p>\r\nInside the building is an imposing hall, which has pillars made from the trunks of 300 Himalayan cedars.

Leh, the hub of Ladakh is as high as 3520 m. Ladakh’s    landscape is as bleak as a desert. Because of its altitude, Ladakh gets hardly any rainfall and hence has neither trees nor a blade of grass growing on the slopes of the rocky, Himalayan terrain. Flowing majestically between the mountains is a tributary of the Indus River. Water from melting snow         collects at various places on the valley floor and small streams join the Indus River.  While the slopes are barren, the valley where the Indus River flows is green.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the  valleys are villages where farms are visible as green tracts of land. This green stretch is so vivid against the bleak slopes that the place looks like Paradise. As the air clears, snow-capped mountains are visible in the distance and in the foreground are lambs grazing on the banks of streams. Regally overlooking all this from the top of the rocky mountains are the gompas (monasteries).\r\n<p>\r\nEntry into Ladakh was restricted because of the Indo-Chinese strife and it is only since 1974, that foreigners are being allowed into the region. Hotels are available only in Leh and the other regions do not have much by way of lodging.\r\n<p> \r\nTourists are cautioned about altitude        sickness. Flying in from Delhi or Srinagar is a time-saving option, but the sudden increase in altitude, causes altitude          sickness. It is therefore advisable to relax in the hotel on the day of arrival. It is also      possible to get to Leh by bus or taxi from Srinagar, which takes 2 days (1 night in Kargil). The natural scenery and architecture are splendid indeed. All the buildings     including temples, have flat roofs as there is little rainfall. Like  the  climate, the main     religion is also different from that of the rest of the country. Most of the people here are of Tibetan descent, though a few new residents are Muslim.

The plains extending from the state\\\'s southern boundary, give way to the hilly heights of the Himalayas. Since most of Himachal Pradesh gets good rainfall throughout the year, it is covered with green forests of Himalayan pine,  a rare sight in India.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe people of this region are gentle in character unlike the people in the plains who are aggressive. While Islam is the main religion in Kashmir and   Ladakh has Buddhism,  the main  religion in Himachal Pradesh is Hinduism. </P>\r\n<p>\r\nGiven the mountainous terrain of Himachal Pradesh, most of the roads are steep with hair-pin bends and curves. Railway lines are almost non-existent. Access to some areas of Himachal Pradesh is     therefore not very easy. If you do travel by road, negotiating the bends with just a wall between the road and the ravines is a thrilling experience. \r\nThe architecture of Himachal Pradesh is unique in character. Sloping roofs to cope with the heavy     rainfall in the region, are a distinctive feature. Temples are built in an architectural style that is commonly used in the plains, but the shikharas (spires) are made of wood instead of stone. Buildings in the eastern part of the state have sloping roofs of an unusual shape. The roofs of houses in Ladakh are flat because of the low rainfall it receives, while in Kashmir, where the rainfall is heavier; the houses are covered by a straight sloping roof, as in Nepal. But in Himachal Pradesh, the sloping roofs have a slight curve which is very intriguing. They strongly     resemble the irimoya roof form in Japan. They could not be a result of Chinese influence, because the Himalayas stand tall between China and this region. Nor could it be a Tibetan influence since there is no direct contact between Tibet and Himachal Pradesh. It  is not likely that this style could have come in from Nepal, because the roofs there are not sloping like these and do not have a curve. This characteristic style, the origins of which still remain a mystery, is reflected not only in the temples and palaces but also in the vernacular architecture of the region.</p> \r\n<p>Due to the inaccessibility of the region, there is very little documentation on the architecture of Himachal Pradesh,  which is quite different from that of the rest of India. \r\n</P>',1,NULL,NULL),(43,'R=1+S=3+P=22+M=616','Chamba 926 m above sea level, is perched on a ledge overlooking the  Ravi River.

Indus is the base from which the English name \\\"India\\\" is derived. The civilization that flourished in the valley is known as the Indus Valley Civilization and the people and their language were known as Sindhu. \r\n<p>\r\nIn Persian, \\\"s\\\" is silent, so ‘Sindhu’ was      distorted to ‘Hindu’. In Europe, Sindhu with its silent \\\'s\\\', when translated, became ‘Indou’ in French, and ‘India’, in English. That was ‘how ‘Sindhu’ changed to ‘India’, which became the official name of this country after Independence. Indians however, prefer to refer to their country as Bharat, which is always written in parenthesis, next to India in any Indian atlas.\r\n<p>\r\nAs the Indus River had five tributaries in its upstream basin, the region was called Punjab or the land of five rivers. ‘Punj’    meaning ‘five’ and ‘ab’ meaning ‘water’. This land was very fertile and rich with              agricultural produce. At the time of Partition, east Punjab became a state of India, while west Punjab went to Pakistan. Lahore the main city of Punjab and the old capital of the Mughal Era became part of Pakistan. \r\nPandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, decided to plan a new city as the capital of Punjab. Le Corbusier, the famous architect selected for the job, designed Chandigarh as the new state     capital. \r\nSubsequently this state was divided into Punjab, where Punjabi-speaking Sikhs      lived, and Haryana, where Hindi-speaking Hindus lived. Chandigarh which lies in-between, became the capital for both the states.  \r\nThe main religion in Punjab is Sikhism which was started in the 16th century, by Guru Nanak. This religion is a combination of Islam\\\'s Sufism (one God and equality of all) and Hinduism (trust in God). It was aimed at removing the caste discrimination that was so prevalent  in Hinduism. \r\n<p>\r\nThe Sikh religion was established in the early 19th century, and a warrior class of      people was formed. Their place of worship is called the gurudwara. Since Sikhism is a    fairly new religion, they did not develop their own style of architecture. They adopted the Mughal architectural style. \r\nSikh believers grow their hair and wear a   turban around the head.

A gurudwara was established in 1589 during the lifetime of the fifth Guru, Arjun Singh. Ahmad Shah Durrani of Afghanistan destroyed it when he invaded India and the present temple was rebuilt in 1764. Later in 1802, Maharaja Ranjit Singh established the Sikh kingdom and plated the roof with gold and what was originally Hari Mandir (temple of God), came to be called the Golden Temple. It is the presence of this temple that has made Amritsar the Holy City for all Sikhs.\r\nThe main building is rather small  and is built in the middle of a tank which is 120m x 150m. This gives it the appearance of floating on water. Believers enter the gate at the edge of the tank Amrita Sarovar (tank of nectar) from which the name for the city was derived and cross over a bridge to enter the temple.  A white marble      terrace about 15 m wide surround the tank. \r\nThe temple and its surrounding precincts, all made of marble along with the water in the tank,  appear pure, different and extraordinary. The entire precinct with water all around it, is           magnificent. \r\nThe central building is designed in the latter Mughal style. It is open on all four sides, does not have any doors that can be closed and does not have any dark spaces. It accentuates the doctrine that all humans are equal.

Actually, designing a whole new city was unthinkable in Europe. CIAM (Congres de Internationeaux Architecture Moderne) put this idea into practice in Brazil and Chandigarh in the third world.

It has become a symbol of youth for India and its people are proud of its state-of-the-art-city status. The city became a tourist spot with long queues of     people waiting to see the Rock Garden. \r\nChandigarh is very different from traditional cities. The chasm between social levels is broad, as is evident in the sparsely populated northern sectors as compared to the southern part. A large colony, ‘Kumhar Colony’ or porters’ colony was developed towards the southern end. This colony has degenerated into a slum. \r\nThere is criticism about Chandigarh’s design but Corbusier\\\'s design caters very well to  Indian sensibilities.

In this, Delhi is different from the three other major Indian cities of, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai which were developed during the British colonization. They do not have too many old buildings since their structures are fairly new. \r\n<p>\r\nThe earliest surviving mosque in India is the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque dating back to 1198.  In 1192 Qutb-ud-din Aibak started the Slave Dynasty, so called because he was a slave of Muhammed Ghori. \r\nUntil the 16th century there were two Muslim dynasties ruling Delhi. The Sultans were the monarchs ruling during this time and this is referred to as the era of the \\\'Sultan dynasty of Delhi\\\'. Siri was the capital of the Khalji dynasty. Tughluqabad or Ferozabad became the capital of the Tughluq dynasty.

The inside of the fort was a town and even now, the road that leads to Lahore Gate, is lined with shops as in a castle market. The army occupies most of the area inside the fort.

The Indus flows westwards and enters the Arabian Sea, while the Ganga flows eastwards and enters the Bay of Bengal.  The state of Uttar Pradesh lies in the great Indo-Gangetic plain on the banks of the Ganga. The land irrigated by river water is very fertile and this state along with Punjab comprise the granary of India. Uttar Pradesh is a densely populated state.\r\n<p>\r\nGanges is the English name for the river, Ganga.  In India, where water is insufficient, rivers are sacred. The Ganga is considered the most sacred of rivers and according to Hindu mythology the Ganga which flowed when God created the world, is the physical and spiritual life source of the country. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is symbolized in Varanasi (Benares), which is on the banks of the river Ganga. Every Hindu aspires to go to Varanasi at least once in his lifetime, to take a bath in the holy Ganga and drink the water. Just above Varanasi, the Ganga branches into the Yamuna River which flows south through Agra and reaches Delhi. These two rivers, the Ganga and Yamuna are revered and statues of river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna, can be seen at the main entrance or at the entrance of the garbha griha of many temples. In the 12th century, when this region came under Islamic rule, many     temples were destroyed and mosques were erected in their place. \r\n<p>\r\nThere was a lot of religious strife, which still persists in Ayodhya, north of Varanasi.

Vandalizing a religious building that belongs to another community is a tragedy indeed.\r\nThe Mughals who ruled over most of India, made Agra and Delhi their capital and the third Mughal emperor, Akbar, tried to bring harmony between the two religions. He even created a new religion called \\\'Din-i-ilahi\\\' which was a blend of Hinduism and Islam.  In architecture too, he tried to blend practical sciences of Hinduism with the Islamic     architectural styles. He incorporated the    trabeated or pillar and beam construction technology of the Hindu architectural style and developed his own unique style of    construction and design.

The city is planned on a grid. The town below the castle, no longer exists. Zones for the mosque and palace were demarcated on the plateau and  red sandstone was used for all structures. Apart from the castle walls, fortifications are minimal. One part of the city wall and the entrance still remain as evidence of plans to build a large city within. Before these plans could materialize, the city was abandoned in 1585, because the         man-made lake to the northwest could not     provide sufficient water for the entire city. As this Fatehpur Sikri was not affected by the war, it has survived as a display of its architectural style to later generations.

A taxi from Baharanpur to visit Murshidabad and Baranagar is ideal.  Since Baranagar is on the banks of the Bhagirathi river, one can go by boat and take a rickshaw from there, too. From Baharampur, go to Barddhaman and from there to Kalna and Guptipala. Bishunupur is two hours away by bus or taxi.  Stay in the tourist lodge there and visit the terracotta temples by rickshaw.  From here, Kolkata is four hours away by bus or train.  If you take a taxi, you can also visit Atpur.  The hotels in these places are very basic. High and medium range hotels are available only in Kolkata, which also has low budget hotels. Some of the quality hotels are the Oberoi Grand, Lytton Hotel and Fairlawn Hotel.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>SIKKIM</b><br />\r\nSikkim is inviting for its cool, mountainous towns and its intriguing Buddhist gompas (monasteries).

A one-way trip to Bodhgaya is possible, but one has to pay the return fare too. It takes one and a half hours to get to Nalanda. Those who are interested in Jainism can visit Pavapuri. Pavapuri to Rajgiri is a 30-minute journey. Bodhgaya via Gaya will take about two hours. Here you can stay in  Hotel Centaur Hokke in Rajgiri and go to Gaya by bus. Hotel Bodhgaya Ashok in Bodhgaya is recommended.  Barabar Hills, can be visited from Gaya by taxi. You can also cross the border and enter Benares and visit Sasaram.

Since the bus services are bad, it is advisable to take a taxi from Bodhgaya to Benares.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>ORISSA</b><br />\r\nBhubaneshwar is the starting point of a tour of the architecture of Orissa (Middle Ages).

Stay at Kalinga Ashok, close to the railway station and     temples. Oberoi Bhubaneshwar, a high class hotel, is far from the temples and therefore not convenient. Hire a rickshaw for a couple of days and see the temples at leisure. \r\n<p>\r\nKhandagiri and Udayagiri can be seen in a single trip. Rajgiri is two and a half hours away and Udayagiri is 30 minutes away. Take a bus to Konark and Puri, but if you wish to visit Hirapur, Dauli and Chaurasi, which are en route, hire a taxi. Hirapur is 10 km away and can be reached by bus. It is around 100 km to Konark. There are simple tourist      bungalows or travellers’ lodges in Konark. If you stay overnight you can pray to the Sun God at dawn. Puri has good hotels, but non-believers are advised to just  visit the place and catch the overnight train, back to Kolkata, since they are not allowed inside the temple.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>BANGLADESH</b><br />\r\nYou have to fly from Kolkata or from Kathmandu in Nepal, because the border between India and Bangladesh is closed. \r\nFlying is a much easier option, because most of Bangladesh in the delta basin, is criss-crossed with tributaries. There are not many places to see and there are very few tourists. It is better to take a taxi from the Dhaka tourist office. Dhaka town can be seen by going around in a rickshaw or auto rickshaw and Sonargaon can be visited by  taxi. Hotel Abakash is a good place to stay.\r\n<p>\r\nFrom Dhaka, fly to Syedpur and take taxis from there to Dinajpur and stay in hotel Al Rashid. One can take a bus trip to Kantanagar or walk the distance in an hour. You cannot get to the temple without a guide from the village. It is difficult to go from here to Paharpur. \r\nFrom Jamalganj, the nearest station to the ruins, the view is incomparable, but the road is terrible. Instead, it is recommended that you go to Bogra, stay in Panjolan Hotel and take a trip to Paharpur. Bogra to Rajshahi is three hours by express bus. Panjolan Hotel  is the best place to stay. Getting to Kusumbha, from here takes an hour-and-a half and Puthia is an hour away. You can relax in Puthia. Fly from Puthia to Dhaka. It takes 3 hours to get to Comilla, but there are no good hotels there. Take a rickshaw to see the ruins. From Comilla, either return to Dhaka or take the bus to Chittagong (4 hours), stay in Shaukat Hotel and fly back to Kolkata. \r\n</p>',1,NULL,NULL),(137,'R=2+S=7+P=0+M=0','<p><img src=\"maps/sikkim.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"420\" border=\"0\" usemap=\"#SMap\"> \r\n<map name=\"SMap\">\r\n  <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"125,203,248,225\" href=\"place.php?placelink=R=2%2BS=7%2BP=58%2BM=0\">\r\n  <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"307,212,415,233\" href=\"place.php?placelink=R=2%2BS=7%2BP=56%2BM=0\">\r\n  <area shape=\"circle\" coords=\"284,230,13\" href=\"place.php?placelink=R=2%2BS=7%2BP=56%2BM=0\">\r\n  <area shape=\"circle\" coords=\"213,255,13\" href=\"place.php?placelink=R=2%2BS=7%2BP=57%2BM=0\">\r\n  <area shape=\"circle\" coords=\"243,260,14\" href=\"place.php?placelink=R=2%2BS=7%2BP=58%2BM=0\">\r\n  <area shape=\"circle\" coords=\"282,263,14\" href=\"place.php?placelink=R=2%2BS=7%2BP=55%2BM=0\">\r\n  <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"19,240,186,259\" href=\"place.php?placelink=R=2%2BS=7%2BP=57%2BM=0\">\r\n  <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"191,281,288,301\" href=\"place.php?placelink=R=2%2BS=7%2BP=55%2BM=0\">\r\n  </map></p>\r\nSikkim is a mountainous state whose borders touch Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan.  The area is small and hilly and the population is around 400,000.  Originally the Lepchya ethnic tribe lived here and later, a Tibetan tribe  migrated in the 17th century. Noteworthy buildings are  Buddhist gompas (monasteries) because the state has cultural links with Ladakhi and Tibetan Buddhism. Sikkim is very green and quite different from Ladakh because it is only  2,000 m above sea level. The monarchy that ruled since the 17th century, came to an end in the 19th century with the advent of British rule.  In 1975, Sikkim was integrated as one of the states of India. Various tribes from Nepal migrated during the 19th century and are now a fairly large group.

People speaking the same language share the same history, the same   culture and even a similar architectural       repertoire. Thus a statewise introduction of architecture is logical. East India comprises Assam in the far east, Bihar where Bihari is spoken, West Bengal where Bengali is spoken, and Orissa where Oriya is spoken. Even the architectural style of each of these states is as distinct as their state languages. Bihar does not have an architectural history, but is important as the place where Buddhism and Jainism         originated.\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries, the kingdom of Magadha  was the cultural centre of Bihar and Rajgir (Rajagriha) was the storehouse of scriptures.  As in ancient Greece, philosophers came here in great numbers, started negating Brahminism and many dissidents arose.  At this time Gautama Buddha (Shaka), who started Buddhism and Mahavira (Daiyuu), who started  Jainism were born into Kshatriya families.  They renounced the world and became ascetics when they were young men.  They preached their doctrine after attaining Nirvana. Buddha taught moderation and Mahavira taught ahimsa (non-violence). Their centre of activity was Bihar and later these religions spread from here to other parts of India.  During the 13th century, Buddhism almost disappeared from India. Apart from Tibetan Buddhism, not much is left by way of Buddhist architecture except for the Daibosatsuji Temple in Bodhgaya and the ruins of Nalanda. \r\n<p>\r\nWhile Jainism did not spread as Buddhism did, it is still a living, flourishing religion with an    architectural culture of its own in west India.  Vaishali in Bihar, is the birthplace of Mahavira and the Parasanad hills are a sacred place for Jains, but architecturally there is not much left here.  From the 13th century Bihar came under the control of the Delhi sultans. They had    developed a distinct architectural style, but they did not develop anything in the central provinces.

After independence from the British, Bengal was also divided into west and east. The west became the state of West Bengal, which is now a part of India and the east became East Pakistan and later  Bangladesh.  The land was divided on the basis of the religion of the       people. The region where there was a majority of Hindus became a part of India and the region that had a majority of Muslims, became Pakistan.  As in the case of Palestine, dividing the country and its people on the basis of their religion, was an unfortunate experience for India.\r\n<p>\r\nFrom ancient times to the Middle Ages, Buddhism was the main religion in Bengal.  Today Buddhist ruins can still be found in Bangladesh. In the 12th century Bengal was taken over by the Hindu Sena dynasty.  In the 13th century it came under Muslim rule.  Even though the ruler was a Muslim, the citizens were steeped in Hindu culture, which is evident from the Bengali-type Hindu temples found in every nook and corner of West Bengal.  West Bengal unlike Orissa, is located in the Delta plains and is not rich in stone for construction purposes. As a result, Bengali houses and    temples were made of bricks. To make the    temples monumental, raw clay panels were moulded, baked in the kiln and used as         decorative cladding over brick walls. This is a unique terracotta style seen only in West Bengal.  It is very similar to the Persian (Iran) style of using coloured tiles on walls, because they too lacked natural building stone.  Unlike the temples in Orissa, Bengali temples are small and cannot be called very grand, but they reflect the Bengali lifestyle and are appealing structures.  Vishnupur with its varied and     beautiful terracotta and laterite temples, is a treasure trove of  Bengali temples.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn the 18th century, when the British founded the East India Company they made Kolkata (Calcutta) their headquarters. Kolkata (Calcutta) was the capital of British India until they shifted their capital to Delhi.  The British built many buildings here and left behind an architectural legacy.

During the 3rd century BC, Emperor  Ashoka unified most of India by conquering this region, killing over 150,000 people in the process. Recoiling from this extreme bloodshed Ashoka renounced  violence and converted to  Buddhism. He   built  stupas  (stone     monuments over earthen mounds) and stambhas (memorial pillars) at various sites. Buddhist ruins (7th-10th  century) are       scattered around the Khandagiri, Udaygiri and Lalitgiri hills. (Giri means mountain or hills). Jain rock-cave temples in Orissa are much older and date back to the 1st century, BC. These Middle Ages buildings are Orissa’s only architectural legacy. Temples with    shikharas that almost touch the sky and the abundant decorations are models of stone   construction. These temples are all built  around Bhubaneshwar. In terms of standard and quality, the temples in Bhubaneshwar  easily measure up to those in Khajuraho. Bhubaneshwar is interesting because every milestone in architectural development from the 7th-13th century is seen here. Maturity in design and the scale of the Lingarajesvara Temple of Bhubaneshwar and the Jagannatha Temple in Puri, is equal to that of Gothic  cathedrals. The Surya Temple in Konark is the zenith of Orissa’s architecture. Hindu temples can be broadly divided into the north and the south style. South temples  have pronounced horizontal lines where the layers of the    structure are stepped. In contrast, the north style of temple has enhanced vertical lines and is crowned with a bullet-like tower. The names of the various parts of the temple are also different. In the north, the whole tower is called shikhara, while in the south;  only the topmost part of the tower is the shikhara. Temples of Orissa and Khajuraho are of the northern type and so are the temples of west India, except that they are larger.  A further study of the Orissa temples reflects that they are built solidly and present an archaic style. Mukhalingam Temples in Andhra Pradesh, are clubbed with those of Orissa in this book, because they reflect the typical Orissa style.',1,NULL,NULL),(211,'R=2+S=11+P=87+M=757','The Kalinga kingdom lost its prominence after being defeated by Ashoka. In the 1st  century  BC,  King Kharavela brought the area from the Gangetic plains to south India under his rule. The eastern part of present Bhubaneshwar, Sisupalgarh was his capital. Achievements of this king are written in an epitaph in Hathi Gumpha (Elephant Cave), the 14th Cave in Udaygiri. The epitaph points to his belief in Jainism and           he dedicated rock-cut cave temples, 6 km from Bhubaneshwar, to Jainism. These are the        earliest architectural traces in Jain history. \r\n<p>\r\nThere are 18 caves left on Udaygiri hills and 15 caves on Khandagiri hills. First among these is the Rani Gumpha (Queen\\\'s Cave) which was in use from the 1st century, BC. It has corridors with a double row of pillars and a row of            rectangular monks’ rooms, and can be called a cave monastery. Above each entrance is an arch, resembling the torana sculptures of Sanchi, on which rules for people’s daily life have been carved.  There are ruins of wooden temples on the hill. \r\n<p>\r\nThe Jain temple in Khandagiri belongs to the 19th century. In the caves around the temple, statues of tirthankaras (saints) from 11th-15th century have been sculpted.

The new city was built by Otto H Koenigsberger, to replace Cuttack as the state capital in 1948. Bhubaneshwar is a medium-sized city with around 500,000 people. Visitors flock here to visit the many temples dating back to the Middle Ages in the old town which is built around the lake Bindu Sagar. There are over a hundred temples of the Nagara style that reflect the splendour of the temple town. \r\n<p>\r\nMost of the structures in the Orissa style are built in and around Bhubaneshwar. From the 8th-13th century  more than 7000 temples were built of sandstone and thus high quality stone construction technology was developed. The stones have been so precisely cut that the joints between the stones cannot be seen at all. Instead of mortar, iron clamps have been used to attach one stone to another and thus towers have been raised up to heights of 50 m.

The early style saw  temples which were very basic with only the garbhagriha and the shikhara over it. Later the mandapa was added and the mandapa and shrine style evolved. The Parasuramesvara Temple also went through this process and the low mandapa was added later. Its          rectangular mandapa has a 2-tiered hipped roof that lets in the sunlight and lets out the smoke. This roof style was also used for wooden houses.

Its unique blend of cultures        transports one into a ‘Thousand and One Nights\\\' ambience. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore Independence, Rajasthan, meaning \\\"Land of Kings\\\", was called Rajputana the land of the Rajputs. The land of the Rajputs which spreads over a large area, includes the Thar Desert and touches Pakistan. Around the 5th century, tribes from Central Asia mixed with the local populace to form the present tribe. This tribe that also advanced into northern and central India is called Rajput. The Rajputs could never establish a unified nation as they were always fighting for supremacy among    themselves. When the Muslims swept into India from the west, they had to fight against them too.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the Mughals established their rule in Delhi and began extending their empire,  Rajput chieftains came under Mughal rule and became their vassals. A new blend of Hindu and Islamic  culture came into being.  All Mughal forts, palaces and tombs reflect this culture and even Hindu temples show a strong Islamic influence. Jaisalmer, an important town in Rajasthan effectively depicts the blend of Indo-Islamic culture.\r\n<p>\r\nRajasthan was attacked from the west and the strife did not end until the Middle Ages. As a result, there is not much left of its ancient architecture. The temples built       during the Middle Ages have been destroyed. Muslims needed to build mosques in the land they conquered, so they pulled down the temples and used the material to construct mosques. To avoid this  Jains started building their temples deep in the mountains. The temples in Mount Abu and Ranakpur are some such examples. These temples, with their excellent          architectural style and exquisite stone     carvings are beyond compare. The temple of Ranakpur, built in the traditional style, with its unconventional interior, is an architectural masterpiece. \r\nAfter colonization British influences crept into Rajput architecture.

The centre of the state juts out into the sea and is called the Kathiawar or Kathiawad peninsula, or Saurashtra. The northern part of Gujarat is Katchch or Kutch, with the Rann or the marshy land extending up to the border of Pakistan. This area is just a few metres above mean sea level.  It becomes a swamp during the rainy season and during the dry season it turns into a desert. The area is   dotted with sparsely populated villages. The houses and the people, who live in this land which is afflicted by very severe weather, are quite unique.\r\n<p> \r\nSince it has a long coastline open to the sea, Gujarat has had trade relations with the West since time immemorial. It also had overseas trade links with Mesopotamia. Most of the ruins of the Indus Valley Civilization are now in Pakistan, but there are some sites scattered in Lothal. There is a famous story that the temple of Somnath looked like a mountain of treasure and Muhammed of Gazni (Afghanistan) attacked this place and plundered it. \r\nMost of the people here speak Gujarati. The main religion in Gujarat was, and is, Jainism. Jainism, which took birth in eastern India, spread to the south and the west. Today the maximum numbers of believers live in Gujarat. Even so, they are just a small       religious group comprising 0.5 per cent of the Indian population. Nonetheless, there are a large number of Jain temples in India. This is because the Jains believe in ahimsa or non-violence. This is why they are neither agriculturists nor military personnel. Most of them are business people and therefore economically well off and in a position to build a  large number of temples. What is unique, is the creation of temple towns in the deep mountains where there is no human habitation. The actual experience of visiting and seeing this spectacle is breathtaking.\r\n<p>\r\nAnother feature worth talking about, are the water bodies starting with the step-wells. In western India, where rainfall is scanty, water sources are sacred. Tanks and wells were                constructed  on a magnificent scale and in large numbers.

If not, stay in Lonavla for a day in a hotel near the station. A simple holiday camp is also available near the caves. Pune, a big city, has many hotels. Hotel Aurora Towers is comfortable. To see Maratha culture, you have to go  further south from here. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>ROCK CAVE TEMPLE GROUP</b><br />\r\nThe best rock-cave temples are at Aurangabad. Fly from Bombay or take the night train. Nasik, en route to Aurangabad is 4 hours from Bombay. Stay overnight at Nasik and continue to Aurangabad (three and a half hours by train). In Nasik, Shalini Palace Hotel (5 km) is a good place to stay at. To get to Pandor, take an auto- rickshaw. It takes 1 hour by bus to get to Sinnar. Aurang Ashok in Aurangabad is a             convenient halt. Explore the city and the caves, in an auto-rickshaw. Ajanta is two and a half hours from here. Go to Wardhapur which is 5 km away from Ajanta, and visit the ruins at a relaxed pace. Stay in the holiday resort. Ellora is an hour by bus from Aurangabad. Visit the temple and tank in Belur village. On the way to Ellora, Daulatabad and Khuldabad can be visited by bus. Take a taxi to Pitalkhora caves (2 hours).

The people here speak Hindi and    culturally too, it is not very different from the rest of north India. Noteworthy structures are all concentrated to the northwest of the state, near Delhi and Agra.  The reason is that the Vindhya Mountains, running from east to west, did not allow much movement between north India and the southeast. Sanchi, which is near the capital, Bhopal, has some important Buddhist ruins. Ruins of temples, monasteries and three stupas of various sizes, are strewn on hilltops giving a serene ambience to the area. To the west of the stupas are toranas (memorial arches), whose exquisite sculpture belongs to the period between the 1st century BC and the  1st century AD.  This Buddhist art was the inspiration for Asian Buddhist art.\r\n<p>\r\nThe most famous group of Hindu temples belonging to the Middle Ages is also located at Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh.  The  architectural style of these temples, the Khajuraho style, is a sub-classification of the Orissa type and the west-Indian type, which again is a sub-classification of the overall north-Indian type. Many temples were built shaped like mountains, because of a belief in mountain worship. The ardhamandapa (porch), mandapa, mahamandapa, vimana and shikhara, built by the next generation resemble a mountain, while the inside of the temple reminds one of cave temples. The statues of males and females based on tantrism, carved in great detail on the wallls,  are a feast for the eyes.  This standard of temples can be seen all the way, from Agra to Sanchi.\r\n<p>\r\nMandu, in west India, is spread over 20 sq km on a plateau, deep in the mountains. It is located in an isolated area, 634 m above sea level. Inside the fort wall is a palace, mosque, tombs, caravan sarai, etc dating back to the 15th century. In  contrast to the  ornamentation adorning Hindu structures, these buildings are austere. Before Mandu was abandoned in the 17th century, it was a             self-sufficient city.\r\n</p>',1,NULL,NULL),(360,'R=4+S=14+P=156+M=0','Two Rajput families from west India advanced into the northern and central parts of India and established their kingdoms there.  The first was the Pratihara dynasty (8th-11th century) and the next was the Chandela dynasty (10th-13th century).  Khajuraho, later called Bundelkhand, was the capital of the Chandela Dynasty.  It is now a small village, with only 4,500 people.  Once, there were 85 architecturally beautiful  temples but now there are only 25. These  abandoned temples are restored by the Archaeological Survey of India and the  area has been designated an archaeological     museum open to the public. The scale of the temples and the quality of  construction is     spectacular.  There are three types of temples, the north Indian type depicted in Khajuraho, the east-Indian type found around Bhubaneshwar and the west Indian type.  The Bhubaneshwar temples were built from the 7th-13th century, while those in Khajuraho were built between 10th-12th centuries and hence have many    similarities. Shikharas of the Khajuraho temples are straight and majestic.\r\n<p>\r\nThe temples can be broadly classified into three groups, the West, East and South Group.There is a wall around the main temple groups.  The garden around the temples is looked after by the Archaeological Survey of India. The West Group is the largest and is close to the hotels, museum and markets. The Matangeshwara Temple, where prayers are still conducted, is outside the wall and the unique Chausatt Yogini Temple stands on a hill, a little away from the other temples. Four temples of the East Group, are about 1-2 km away scattered in the village. In the east, amidst  fields, are Jain temples, which are the main temples in the East Group.

As seen from the cross section, the shikharas are very tall, but the rooms inside, especially the shrine under the tallest shikhara, is small.\r\n<p>\r\nThis temple is constructed in the centre of a high platform, with four small shrines at the four corners, which make it a Pancharatna temple or a five-shrine temple.  Jain temples are built with the tirthankara facing all four sides called Chaumukha and they are extended on all four sides too.  As Hindu temples are \\\"Houses of God\\\", they cannot be extended on all four sides. The shrine has to be a room, closed on all sides except for the main door.

The temple consists of an ardhamandapa, mandapa, mahamandapa, garbhagriha and pradakshina or cirumbulatory which is the      corridor around the shrine. The grandeur, scale  and proportion of this temple, make it one of the best examples of the north Indian type.\r\n<p>\r\nGranite has been used for the construction of the Chausatt Yogini Temple, the Lalguan  Mahadeva Temple and the Brahma Temple.  The other temples are all made of sandstone. The walls are exquisitely carved with statues of gods, humans, animals, and other mythological beings.  There is a wonderful statue of mithuna (man and woman lovingly embracing) inside the temple. These erotic groupings can be seen in Hindu temples all over this region, especially in Khajuraho and Konark.  The exact reason for the presence of such statues is not known. Perhaps, it was a good luck symbol for the    people of the Middle Ages.\r\n<p>\r\nThe shikhara of this temple is exceptional.  Eighty-four small shikharas have been sculpted on the surface of the main shikhara and each small shikhara is crowned with an amalaka and an inverted pot shaped finial called kalasha.

During the 2nd half of the 14th century, the Mughals conquered the Deccan plateau. Shivaji fought against them and established the Maratha kingdom, which was mainly Hindu. His base of operations being the mountains, Shivaji built forts in Raigad and other places and used guerrilla warfare. When the Mughals weakened, this area was taken over by the British. The Maratha alliance then made Pune their base and fought 3 battles against the British. Shivaji, is the first national hero, who fought against the British for India\\\'s Independence.

There were also many man-made caves. These caves, where the monks renounced the world and lived together, came to be called viharas and the caves where stupas were built and prayers offered, were called chaitya caves. Chaitya caves had high ceilings and were monumental. The     oldest Buddhist monasteries in Gandhara are made of brick. Hence the cave monasteries in the Deccan plateau are second in the   hierarchy of monasteries. Rock caves are found all over India, but the greatest number is in the Deccan plateau. \r\n<p>\r\nThe most interesting aspect of the cave    temples, with their pillars and beams is that they were built according to wooden         structures. Wooden structures built using this technology have long since broken, but these rock caves are a historical resource. When Hinduism adopted the idea of cave temples, the caves were transformed dynamically and became rich and bright. Hindus went one step further and started carving on the rocks from the top, thus creating the \\\"rock-cut     temples\\\" that are 3-dimensional and look exactly like the temples built in masonry.

Christian missionaries travelled to southeast Asia to preach their religion. One of them, Francis Xavier, even reached Japan. After he died on the high seas, his body was embalmed, and is now kept in the Basilica do Bom Jesus, in Goa. The body of this saint is brought out for public veneration once every 10 years. At that time, people not just from India, but from all over the world come to Goa.\r\n<p>\r\nThis city called \\\'Golden Goa\\\' fell prey to bubonic plague, around the time the new capital was being formed at Panaji. The city of Goa was subsequently abandoned. Now, the old European city on the banks of the Mandovi River is being preserved by         protecting the churches and monasteries, as they are.

Kannada. It used to be called Mysore state with Mysore city being the    cultural heart of the state. Now the state    capital is Bangalore.\r\n<p>\r\nKarnataka has rich and varied architecture. The three cities of Gulbarga, Bijapur and Bidar in the north have many structures  reflecting South Indian Islamic architecture. Among them Bijapur is worth an intensive visit;  not for nothing is it called the ‘Agra of South India’. \r\n<p>\r\nMuch further south (except for Srirangapatnam, or as the British called it, Seringapatam) was the Hindu cultural centre of the 18th century.  Aihole, Badami and Mahakuta in the north, were the hub of     construction activities during the Middle Ages. The Nagari style of the North in the later period and the Dravidian style of the south (early period) co-existed here. These were built by the early Chalukyas in the 6th~8th centuries. The later Chalukyas  built temples that were a blend of the north and south styles with a star-shaped plan. James Fergusson, the first historian to chronicle Indian architecture, called it a “Chalukya style which is a blend of Aryan and Dravidian styles. It later came to be called the              ‘in-between style’”. Generally however, even now it is referred to as the Chalukya style. \r\nThis in-between style was developed by the Hoysala dynasty further south and was called the Hoysala style.  The three temples in Belur, Halebid and Somnathpur, adopt the star plan and have highly decorated walls with exquisite carving. In Vijayanagar (Hampi),  the capital of the last Hindu empire in South India there are many ruins. The effect of Islamic architecture is heavy in the fort and palaces. The temples in the capital look traditional except for the Vitthala temple which is different from the Hoysala style and could be called the Indian rococo style with its fantastically decorated interiors. The  kingdom extended from Tamil Nadu to Orissa and in every area a Vijayanagar style temple was constructed. \r\n<p>\r\nJain temples were built on the west coast. Buddhism and Jainism spread to South India from Bihar.  It is a wonder that on the east coast one finds largely, ruins, while on the west coast there are numerous shrines  and many temple towns. The west coast separated from the interior by the Western Ghats receives a lot of rains and hence the wooden constructions have steep roofs like that of the temple in Muda Bidri.

The Mughals did not extend their empire this far south, which is why there is little or no trace of Islam in Tamil Nadu. Pure Hindu culture still thrives here.\r\n<p>\r\nThere are not many old ruins to be found here.  Buddhist temples were supposed to have been constructed in every region, but nothing is left of them now. There are a large number of temples and all of them were built in the Dravidian style. Any differences would be only stylistic, reflecting changes down the ages.\r\n<p>\r\nThe south style developed mostly in north Karnataka and around Mahabalipuram (Mamallapuram) and Kanchipuram. In the 7-8th centuries the Pallava dynasty built the Stone temples. Even now in Mahabalipuram there are many small stone temples and cave temples. \r\n<p>\r\nRock-cut architecture was gradually replaced by structures which were built with brick and stone. The Shore temple at Mahabalipuram is the best example of structural architecture. The evolution of the south Indian style can be seen in the stepped towers. The formation of the gopura can be seen in the Ganesha Ratha, a stone sculpture. The mature style of this temple can be seen in the Kailasanatha temple and in the Vaikunta Perumal temple of Kanchipuram.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Chola Dynasty became stronger in the 9th century and this power is reflected in their architecture which was on a             magnificent scale. Two 60m high temples were constructed one in each capital of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram during the 11th century. The vimana or shrine of one was made strong and straight and manlike and the other was made       beautiful with feminine curves. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the 13th century the power of the Cholas weakened and the Vijayanagar Empire rose. Temple architecture development that was taking a straight course changed direction without reason. From then on the temples became larger, more complex with a great number of buildings inside a wide rectangular area. The main shrine became small and could not be distinguished from the outside.The gopuras on the outer walls became larger and more magnificent, as can be  seen in those at Madurai or Srirangam where the gopura stands more than 70m tall. \r\nThis typical Dravidian architecture can be seen 1000 km away in ancient Egyptian architecture too. The Egyptian Karnak and Edof temples too have small shrines while the Pylon on the outside is as large as the  gopuras that crown the Dravida temples. \r\n</p>',1,NULL,NULL),(597,'R=5+S=19+P=254+M=0','Madras now known as Chennai, is one of the four metropolitan cities of India.

In the 14th  century it came under the control of the Delhi Khilji dynasty and became a Muslim kingdom.

Kerala is a long, narrow state,       sandwiched between the 1000-1500 m  high Western Ghats on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. Moisture laden winds, drop heavy rainfall on the windward side of the mountains. This rich green state is very     different in culture from the dry state of Tamil Nadu. Its population comprises 50 percent Hindus and 20 percent each of Christians and Muslims. This diversity of cultures is a result of Kerala’s trade with other countries right from ancient times and the consequent exposure to other religions. Churches are visible  all over the state, but it is a matter of regret that none of them are of an admirable architectural quality.\r\n<p>  \r\nIt is perhaps, because so many religions    co-exist in Kerala, that Hinduism is very rigid. One has to be dressed like a Hindu  to enter the temple. Even then, visitors are not allowed to walk freely around the precincts and photography is prohibited. The only place where a visitor’s movements are not curtailed and one can look around, is             at the Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvanathapuram. The  style of this temple is like the temples in Tamil Nadu; even the language spoken is Tamil, not Malayalam.\r\n<p>\r\nWhile wooden structures are prevalent all over India, they are particularly common in Himachal Pradesh in the north and Kerala in the south, because of the easy availability of wood in these two states. Another common feature in the architecture of the two states, is the tall steeple roof, which is protection against very high rainfall. Kerala has very few wooden temples, but it is interesting  to note that there are quite a few wooden mosques like those in Kashmir. J Fergusson has noted the similarity between the wooden constructions in Nepal and those in Kerala. It is perhaps the similar climatic conditions that gave rise to similar architecture. The major difference is that roofs in Kerala are gabled with decorations on them, while Nepal has hipped roofs. Roofs in Kerala are not curved like they are in Himachal Pradesh, but straight like those in Nepal.\r\n</p>',1,NULL,NULL),(656,'R=5+S=20+P=280+M=1146','When entering Kerala from Mangalore, on the Malabar coast, the temples have the west coast style.
